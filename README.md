📷 What is an Image?

    🖼️ A collection of pixels.
    🔳 A pixel is the smallest unit in an image, containing:
        Color values: Red, Green, and Blue (RGB).
        Intensity information: Specific to that point in the image.
    🔍 Resolution:
        An image is defined by the number of pixels per inch (PPI).
        A good-quality image for printing typically requires at least 300 PPI.

🎥 What is a Video?

    A video is essentially a collection of images played sequentially to depict motion over time.

🖌️ What is Image Processing?

    🛠️ Image processing is a method to perform operations on an image to:
        🎨 Enhance the image.
        🔍 Extract useful information.

🤖 What is Computer Vision?

    📖 Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field focused on how computers:
        👁️ Understand digital images and videos at a high level.
        🛠️ Automate tasks the human visual system performs effortlessly (e.g., object recognition, motion detection).

📚 What is OpenCV?

    OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a powerful open-source library used for:
        📷 Image processing.
        🤖 Computer vision applications like face detection, edge detection, and motion tracking.

💻 How Does the Computer See an Image?

    A computer sees an image as a 2D matrix, where:
        Each entry represents the pixel value (color or intensity).
        For processing, we commonly use the NumPy library in Python for handling image matrices.
        Example: image1

📝 Types of Images:

    🖤 Grayscale Images:
        Single-channel images.
        Pixel values are based on brightness or dullness only (e.g., 0 = black, 255 = white for 8-bit images).

    🌈 Colored Images:
        Three-channel images.
        Pixel values are decided by the intensity of Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) components.
